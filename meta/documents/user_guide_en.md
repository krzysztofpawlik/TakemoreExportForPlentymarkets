## 1 Setting up the data format TakemoreNet-plugin in plentymarkets

By installing this plugin you will receive the export format **TakemoreNet-plugin**. Use this format to exchange data between plentymarkets and Takemore.Net. It is required to install the Plugin Elastic export from the plentyMarketplace first before you can use the format **TakemoreNet-plugin** in plentymarkets.

Once both plugins are installed, you can create the export format **TakemoreNet-plugin**. Refer to the [Exporting data formats for price search engines](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/basics/data-exchange/export-import/exporting-data#30) page of the manual for further details about the individual format settings.

Creating a new export format:

1. Go to **Data » Elastic export**.
2. Click on **New export**.
3. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in table 1.
4. **Save** the settings.
→ The export format will be given an ID and it will appear in the overview within the **Exports** tab.

The following table lists details for settings, format settings and recommended item filters for the format **TakemoreNet-Plugin**.
